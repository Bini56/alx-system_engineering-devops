 this is a regular expression project, and #regular expression is A regular expression, often abbreviated as "regex", is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. It is used for matching strings or sets of strings within a larger body of text. Regular expressions provide a flexible and powerful way to search, manipulate, and validate text based on patterns.

In programming and text processing, regular expressions are commonly used for tasks such as:

Searching for specific patterns in text
Validating input (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers)
Extracting information from text
Text substitution and manipulation
Regular expressions consist of a combination of characters and metacharacters that define the search pattern. They allow you to specify complex patterns using features such as wildcards, character classes, quantifiers, and more.

Different programming languages and tools have their own implementations of regular expressions, but the basic principles and syntax are quite similar across most of them.
